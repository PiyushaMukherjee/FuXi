# FuXi – AI-Powered 15-Day Global Weather Forecasting 🌍☁️  

## 📌 Overview  
**FuXi** is a **machine learning-based weather forecasting system** that provides **15-day global weather predictions** with high accuracy. By leveraging **deep learning models trained on 39 years of ERA5 reanalysis data**, FuXi enhances long-term forecasting performance compared to traditional **numerical weather prediction (NWP)** models.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Forecasting** – Uses ML models for efficient weather predictions.  
✅ **15-Day Global Forecasts** – Provides long-range weather predictions.  
✅ **High Accuracy** – Outperforms traditional physics-based models like ECMWF.  
✅ **6-Hour Temporal Resolution** – Forecast updates every 6 hours.  
✅ **0.25° Spatial Resolution** – Covers global locations with fine granularity.  
✅ **Cascaded ML Approach** – Reduces long-term forecast errors.  
✅ **Ensemble Forecasting** – Improves prediction reliability through perturbations.  

## 📊 How It Works  
1. **Data Training** – The model is trained on **39 years of ECMWF ERA5** weather data.  
2. **Cascaded ML Model** – Reduces cumulative forecast errors for better accuracy.  
3. **Prediction Generation** – Generates **temperature, pressure, and wind** predictions every 6 hours.  
4. **Comparison with ECMWF** – Benchmarked against ECMWF's **ensemble mean** for performance validation.
