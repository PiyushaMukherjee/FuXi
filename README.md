# FuXi ‚Äì AI-Powered 15-Day Global Weather Forecasting  

## Overview  
I have implemented this research paper as an **IDP Project** in my **6th semester at SRM University AP**. This project leverages **machine learning** to provide **15-day global weather forecasts**, trained on **39 years of ERA5 reanalysis data**. It enhances long-range predictions compared to traditional **numerical weather prediction (NWP)** models.  

## Features  
- **AI-driven weather forecasting** with **6-hour temporal resolution**  
- **0.25¬∞ spatial resolution** covering global locations  
- **Cascaded ML approach** to reduce long-term forecast errors  
- **Ensemble forecasting** for uncertainty estimation  

## Methodology  
- Trained deep learning models on **ERA5 reanalysis data (1980‚Äìpresent)**  
- Used **cascaded ML models** to enhance prediction accuracy  
- Benchmarked against **ECMWF ensemble mean** for performance validation  

## Tech Stack  
- **Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Scikit-Learn**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
